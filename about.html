<p class="words">About Steven Gardner</p>

<p class="words2">My name is Steven Gardner, I am a sophmore at West High School and have 2 older brothers.
I am 25% thai/chinese and 75% caucasian. I live with my dad in Davenport Iowa. My mother lives in
Bloomington Illinois. I am very interested in computers and making machines and listening to
music. I enjoy taking classes for progamming, such as Introduction to Robotics or Web Design.
Ever since 4th grade I went to Pleasant Valley School Districts, but due to complications with
my living location I had to move to Davenport School after my freshman year. </p>

<p class="words">Here are some of things that somewhat describe who I am.</p>
