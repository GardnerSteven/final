<p>My Name is Steven Gardner and I made this website. Hopefully if your seeing this its a reason for you to guage my skills as a Web Developer.
I love programming. Ive learned how to program a CNC, VEX Robots, Pick & Place Robotic Arms, and now websites. I don't like to shy away from
hard work. and this website was hard work, it took me 1 entire day to make because I was dedicated to getting it done after working 5 hours.
If thats not reason enough for you to see my potential, why don't you take a look around, explore my website. Ill be waitng here for your response.</p>
