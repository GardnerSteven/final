<p class="words2">I would consider finding another language to code in but over all a prefer html. If I had to pick another language to learn I would pick Java Script.
  Mostly because you can use it in html and to make video games. At the start of sophmore year Java Script was one of my first classes and I would mind brushing up
on it, because when I started the year I was already preoccupied trying to make new friends and being introducted to a new school it was difficult but now that I have
 more room on my plate I would like to reteach myself. I would most likely use freecodecamp to reteach myself because I already started the lessons in order to pass
Web Design.</p>
