  I actually have alot of hobbys that all somehow collide and come full circle to help me.
  To truely understand what I mean by that you'd have to know my hobbys first. Ive desided to
  use this opertunity to use a requirement on my rubric by using an unordered list to display my hobbys.</p>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Making Gadgets.</li>
  <li>Fixing Misc Items.</li>
  <li>Taking Care of Pets.</li>
  <li>Doing Construction <br>Jobs With my Dad.</li>
</ul>
<p class="words">-Making Gadgets</p>
<p class="words2">By this I mean when I have a problem with something electronic I rig up a device to replace it, like a computer fan wired to a usb
if my desk fan wairs out.</p>
<br>
<p class="words">-Fixing Misc Items</p>
<p class="words2">When I say this its sounds similar to the first hobby ,but what I mean is if something like a chair or table
  leg brakes I like to fix it.</p>
<br>
<p class="words">-Taking Care of Pets</p>
<p class="words2">This one seems pretty self explanatory, but I kind of want to elaborate on my pets. I have a mutt pitbull named Clancy and a
 growing kitten named Morty.</p>
<br>
<p class="words">-Doing Construction Jobs With my Dad</p>
<p class="words2">This one is also kind of self explanatory, Sometimes I like to go to work with my dad in the summer and doing odd jobs, like roofing
or floor or something else.</p>
