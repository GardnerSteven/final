<p class="words">I don't have a lot of previous job expreience, but the
  experience I do have is more hands on and not really technology
so here is the list of jobs Ive done.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Sign Holding</p>
<img src="images/signspin.gif" alt="sign spinning" border="10">
<p class="words">My current job is as a sign holder for various places,
  but currently my boss has us holding signs for a going out of buisness Yonkers.<br>
  I work 5 hours on Saturday and Sundays, and sometimes Fridays.
  By far out of all the jobs Ive work this has been the easiest, All I have to do<br>
  hold a sign and eat lunch that my boss gives me(but it comes out of my pay).</p>

<p class="subtitle">Roofing</p>
<img src="images/roof.gif" alt="roofing fail" border="10">
<p class="words">A while back when I worked with my dad for a main job,
I did a little bit of roofing out in Peoria. It was the hardest job i've
ever had to do. I watched my oldest brother fall off the roof onto landscaping
rocks and bricks, and had to pick up the ground and clean the gutters. That
might not sound that hard, but imagine having to carry(more like drag) a
120 lbs of shingles on a tarp all the way from the home to the dumpster,
unload it and bring it back 10x over.</p>
